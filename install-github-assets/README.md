This script is part of an endeavor for setting up software development environment automatically on Android devices.

As an individual lots of on the move I'm contributing to my well being and physical ergonomics by carrying lighter devices on me. 

At this point I feel using [Code-Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server?tab=readme-ov-file) with [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) locally on Android device aren't my favourite tools for developing considering cognitive ergonomics. Regardless of this at my current situation as an **software developer** and **unemployed ITC engineering student** whose **study loan capital keeps increasing** this is great opportunity to learn new skills for developing with no cost.
